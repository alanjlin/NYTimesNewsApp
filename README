In this project I chose to create the New York Times app using the NYT API and alamofire to process the JSON requests that the get returned. The project satisfies requirements 1-6, since it uses everything in a programmatic layout and uses a tab bar controller to switch between the search/most popular views. I used a collection view for both the search and the most popular views, and therefore used the same collectionview cells for each and therefore pushed the same detailview when clicked on, so the detail view is the same as long as the article is the same regardless of if the article was accessed using the search functionality or the most popular API. In my search functionality, I used the method from the searchBar that triggers and reads the text in the search bar every time anything in the search bar is modified (kind of like the google search engine), and therefore submits a request with the query in the parameters using the alamofire method. I then append each of the relevent entries into the array that displays onto the collectionview.
